# spacebook-react

## Info
The app was built on Linux ubuntu 20.04 using [react native cli](https://reactnative.dev/docs/enviroanment-setup), not Expo! This is because Linux provides an easier way to install and manage development dependencies like java, android studio and node.


## Comands

- yarn
- npm i
- npx react-native start
- npx react-native run-android
- npm run dev
- adb shell cmd jobscheduler run -f com.typescript 999

## Styling Guide 
The chosen style guide was [Airbnb](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/). However, due to its support with Typescript, more configuration is required with 'prettier' as there were conflicting styles that needed me to suppress 'eslinter,' a Typescript linter manually. In reflection, more time is needed to get 'prettier', 'eslinter'  and Airbnb working efficiently together.
